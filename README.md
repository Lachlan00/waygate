# WAYGATE

This is an art project/social experiment to embed secret message stashes in physical location around the world.

## Overview

There are literally thousands of models wifi enabled 'smart' devices (power boards, light globes etc) available and almost all are based on the ESP8266 board. This is a replacement firmware that removes the 'smartness' of these devices turning them back into regular devices from an electrical perspective. Their processing power is used to broadcast an open wifi hotspot which serves a captive portal where people can leave short, anonymous messages for each other. These devices can be hidden in plain sight around a city or campus.

Inspired by the covert messaging that takes place in the form of street art, flyers or zines but with cypherpunk flare.

The name [Waygate](https://wot.fandom.com/wiki/Ways) comes from Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series:

> "The Ogier were instructed to plant talismans in locations outside a stedding where they would wish to grow Waygates, and activate the talismans via treesinging. The subsequent Waygates provided access to a world outside of reality, which linked all Waygates together in an intricate logistical system."
